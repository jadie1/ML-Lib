To get the results for the Car dataset, run:
	python RunCar.py

To get the results for the Bank dataset, run:
	python RunBank.py

These scripts print the results and save them to output files 'CarResults.csv' and 'BankResults.csv'
Note running these scripts requires the car and bank data folders to be in the directory
The decision tree implementation code is all in DecisionTree.py
